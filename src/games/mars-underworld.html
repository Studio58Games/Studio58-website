            A lonely place
        </h2>

        <p id="p1">
            Earth, 2060. 

            <br><br>

            Humans have polluted their planet so much that it has become impossible to live there anymore. The human race then decided to flee and set up on Mars. Elon Musk, who was considered as a fool at that time became a hero. Thanks to him, there was hope.

            <br><br>

            You weren't aware of any of this. You thought Elon Musk was just funny memes on the web. When you received a message from the government on your phone, you didn't understand at first.

            <br><br>
            
            <span style="color: #aaaaaa">

                    "Immediate embarkation" ? <br>
                    "Space rocket" ?
                </i> 
            </span>

            <br><br>

            Humanity is leaving. Without realising what you are doing, you're driving to nearest rocket station at full speed. From that moment on, you can only remember panic and fear. You don't even know how you managed to get into the rocket.

            <br><br><br><br>

            You've been living on <span style="color: #cc3333">Mars</span> for the last two months. You are almost used to this new life but find it hard not to feel <span style="color: #cc3333">lonely</span>. 

            <br><br>

            Early in the morning, the village generator stopped. You decide to check what is going on. You don't know the path much but it looks passable. But while you were lost in your thoughts you feels the ground collapsing and fall for what seems an eternity. The landing is painful. When you open your eyes you realize the crevasse you are in is so deep that you can hardly see the top. 

            <br><br>

            You set off with difficulty to find a way to escape this cave.

            Gameplay
        </h2>

        <p id="p2">
            Mars Underworld is a RPG entirely made of ascii-arts. The player can choose between many classes (fortune teller, warrior, engineer, military, ...). Every class has a given amount of <span style="color: #33aa33">health</span> and a special ability that requires <span style="color: #33aa33">energy</span> (summon allies, heal yourself, ...). The energy can be refilled through items you can find in the game.

            <br><br>

            The goal is to find a way back to your village. There are many places to explore (moutain, forest, maze, ...) and several secret exits. During your journey, you will meet kind creatures and evil monsters. You may fight them, but any action you take could have terrible consequences later or give you access to new areas of this world.
