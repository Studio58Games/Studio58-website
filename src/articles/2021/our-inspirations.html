    <h2>What we love in video games</h2>
    <p>
        The two games we love the most are
        <a target=”_blank” href="https://exok.com/games/celeste/">Celeste by Extremely Ok Game</a>,
        <a target=”_blank” href="https://www.hollowknight.com/">Hollow Knight by Team Cherry</a>
        and today I will explain why.<br><br>

        We both played these games, and even completed a Celeste save file together in a week.<br>
        <strong>Music</strong> is surely what we love the most in video games. When I spend time with Pierre, we ALWAYS have game soundtracks playing in the background.<br>
        The soundtracks of 
        <a target=”_blank” href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/celeste-original-soundtrack">Celeste by Lena Rain</a> and 
        <a target=”_blank” href="https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-original-soundtrack">Hollow Knight by Christopher Larkin</a>
        are absolutely stunning and represent a big part of our appreciation of these games.<br><br>

        <strong>Visuals</strong> are the second thing that made us fall in love with these two games.<br>
        The pixel arts of Celeste are so beautiful and are a reason why we use pixel art.
        And even if we know the game by heart, we are still amazed by Hollow Knight's backgrounds.<br><br>

        <strong>Gameplay</strong> is also pretty important to us, but as it is sometime impossible to compare two very different gameplays, we tend to compare them very rarely.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>What we want to create</h2>
    <p>
        We surely don't want to copy the games we love. Our goal is to create the <strong>perfect game for us</strong>.<br><br>

        I think what we want the most with our games is to <strong>tell stories</strong>, because there is not such satisfaction as making someone feel something.<br>
        Also, Pierre is really excited about composing music for our games (and he is really good at it) so I can want to listen to his stunning soundtracks.<br><br>

        In terms of gameplay, at the moment I am writting this, we are thinking like this :<br>
        As we do not have a game idea that we both specificaly want to transform into a real game, we will try a lot of things (by taking part in Game Jams for example)
        until we create a prototype we think is interesting.
