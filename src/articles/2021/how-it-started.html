        <h2>
            Two curious kids : Vincent and Pierre
        </h2>

        <p>
            Before graduating in the computer science school where we met, Vincent and I didn't know much about programmation.
            We both had had a few lessons during our preparatory class and liked it. 
            But when we really got into it we fell in love with it. As we got along pretty well we naturally started
            making school projects together. And when we discovered oriented object programmation we decided 
            to train through a project of our own : Mars Underwold.

            <br><br>

            <div class="wrapped-image">
                <a href="../../games/mars-underworld.html"><img class="zooming" id="mars-underworld" src="../../../res/mars-underworld/background.png"></a>
                <p>
                    Mars Underwold is the first game we ever made. It was a RPG with a lot of funny 
                    content and private jokes. 
                    We were so hyped while making it that we kept adding stuff in the game without 
                    realising it.
        
                    <br><br>
        
                    As we had no knowledge about coding games and graphical interfaces we decided to 
                    print the game in a linux console (therefore only with text). Quickly, we added 
                    ascii-arts that we found online to give life to the game. And it did the trick.
                    In the end we had so much fun we knew we would make new games in the future.

        <h2>
            One summer to learn
        </h2>

        <p>
            When our first school year ended Vincent and I spent 2 months on our own. I knew I had a lot
            to learn to make games properly (and not just displaying text). So during the summer of 2020,
            I spent the most important part of my time learning how to make 3D games. I had been advised
            to directly learn how to make games with game engines like Unity or Unreal. But I was too 
            curious about how these softwares were working. I wanted to code my own engine to understand 
            how they worked.

            <br><br>

            And so I learned that a framework is an environnement that gives you functions you can 
            call to render objects on a screen while an engine calls your code to give caracteristics 
            to what will be rendered. In other words, when using a framework you are the master
            but it takes a lot more time to do what you want. On the other hand a game engine is the 
            master and you feed it with code.

            <br><br>

                <p>
                So I decided to use the framework that was used to create Minecraft : LWJGL. Basically, 
                this is a wrapper of OpenGL functions. OpenGL is an application programming interface for
                rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. What it allows you to do is communicate stuff between
                your computer processor to your graphics card. 

                <br><br>

                I learned everything from the excellent series of video from ThinMatrix. Rendering 3D objets,
                textures, shaders (coloring effets like lighting and shadows), graphical user interfaces,
                particules rendering, water simulation, terrain generation, ...  In the end I made a game race
                game where you control a chicken riding a raft and dodge trunks and cannonballs.

        <h2>
            Exporting games to consoles
        </h2>

        <p>
            Now that I had learned the basis I wanted to create games with Vincent on a custom engine.
            The problem was that the engine I had written this summer could not export games to consoles 
            like PS4 or the Nintendo Switch. After doing some research I realized that this was a 
            difficult task so I had to choose a new framework that could do it. I finally chose Monogame 
            because it was told to give a lot of freedom to the developper (and because one of my 
            favorite game Celeste had been created with it).

            <br><br>

            In february 2021, Vincent and I made our second finished game (Star Breakout)  on this 
            engine and exported it on Windows, macOS and Linux. It was exceptionnally satisfying to finally make a 
            simple but complete game with graphics, music and gameplay, one year after Mars UnderWorld.
